## Hey There!üëãüèΩ

I'm a software engineer who loves AI and platform engineering ‚Äì particularly where systems design meets privacy challenges. I build open source tools with Python, Go, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms. Previously trained as a physician, which shaped how I think about the human side of technology.
My work sits between technical implementation and bigger questions: How do we build AI that's both powerful and trustworthy? What does responsible innovation actually look like? I spend a lot of time thinking about ethics, philosophy, and the systems we're creating.
When I'm not coding or deep in thought, I'm usually cycling, DJ'ing, hunting for books at the library, or writing poems. Always happy to chat about tech, philosophy, or whatever interesting problems you're working on.
