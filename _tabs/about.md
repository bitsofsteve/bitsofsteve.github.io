I am a Software Engineer specializing in Infrastructure, Reliability, and DevOps, with a passion for exploring the intersection of technology and healthcare. My areas of expertise include Linux, databases, open source software, distributed computing (Kubernetes), containerization, and cloud platforms (Azure, AWS, GCP). I have a keen interest in artificial intelligence, healthcare engineering, and privacy ethics, as I believe these fields hold the key to transforming healthcare and improving lives.

In the past, I have worked with various programming languages, but my current focus is on Python, Go, and shell scripting (BASH & Powershell). When I'm not coding, you can find me coffee hunting, designing furniture, teaching, and enjoying a good laugh ðŸ˜„. I'm always game for a conversation about anything from software development to space rocks.

If you have any questions, want to discuss my interests, or simply want to chat, don't hesitate to reach out to me at (email address below). Let's create a better world together, one line of code at a time! ðŸš€


>> Software Engineer at [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/), a nonprofit organization dedicated to building a privacy-preserving, decentralized, and open source ecosystem for AI.
