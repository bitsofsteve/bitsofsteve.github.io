Hey There!👋🏽

Nice of you to drop by!🙂

My life is in multiple strands (I promise they all converge) - Software Engineer, Physician, Researcher in Engineering & Public Policy, with a special interest in AI Technical Governance and Ethics in Healthcare and Human Centred Computing.


As a Software Engineer, I currently work at [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/), a nonprofit organization dedicated to building a privacy-preserving, decentralized, and open source ecosystem for AI. My work focuses on building tools and infrastructure to enable secure and privacy-preserving machine learning workflows. I work with technologies such as **Python, Golang, Kubernetes, Linux, Docker, and cloud platforms (Azure, AWS, GCP) to build scalable and reliable systems**. I am also passionate about open source software and have contributed to various projects in the past. 


As a Physician(Not practicing any more😬), I have a keen interest in the intersection of technology and healthcare. I am passionate about leveraging technology to improve healthcare delivery, patient outcomes, and the overall quality of life. I have worked on projects that involve the use of AI and machine learning in healthcare, with a focus on **medical imaging, clinical decision support systems, and predictive analytics**. I am also interested in the ethical implications of AI in healthcare and how we can ensure that AI technologies are developed and deployed responsibly. **I founded [Biokraken](https://biokraken.org/)**, a platform that aims to bridge the gap between healthcare and technology by providing resources, insights, and tools for healthcare professionals and technologists in Africa.


My research interests lie at the intersection of Engineering and Public Policy, with a focus on AI Technical Governance and Ethics. I am interested in understanding how we can develop and implement policies and regulations that promote the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies. I am also interested in exploring the ethical implications of AI in healthcare and how we can ensure that AI technologies are developed and deployed responsibly. Currently I'm working on a project that aims to develop a framework for AI Technical Governance in healthcare, with a focus on ensuring that AI technologies are developed and deployed in a way that is ethical, transparent, and accountable.


Outside of work, I enjoy reading 📚, writing 📝, and exploring new places.🌏
