Gather 'round, young friends, and hear,
A story about Kubernetes, so clear,
A tale that's fun and easy to grasp,
In a simple poem, you'll soon clasp.

Imagine a harbor full of ships,
Each carrying cargo on many trips,
The harbor master, strong and wise,
Keeps things organized, no surprise.

Now think of computers, big and small,
Working together, answering every call,
To store data and run code,
A world of software, a heavy load.

Kubernetes is the master of this place,
Helping computers keep up with the race,
It tells them what to do, and when,
Like a wise leader, guiding them.

Containers are the ships that sail,
Holding applications, never frail,
They run the code and keep it tight,
So everything works just right.

Pods are docks, where ships reside,
For containers to safely hide,
Kubernetes takes care, you see,
Of pods and ships, so easily.

Services are the routes we take,
To find the ships, no mistake,
They guide us through, with clear signs,
To reach the containers, crossing lines.

The harbor, now you understand,
Is orchestrated by a skilled hand,
Kubernetes, our trusty friend,
Makes sure our apps run to the end.

So remember, young friends, as you learn,
Kubernetes is here, at every turn,
A helpful guide, strong and true,
To manage the code, and help you too.
